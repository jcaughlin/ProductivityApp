# The Disorganizer


### The Do Everything App for the Disorganized

**_Problem Statement_**

Modern living can be a challenge. There are so many things to do and so little time. For those some of us, it can be much much worse. Time blindness is real and it isn't just annoying, it can hurt one's employment, cost friends and stress relationships...

In my case, I am late to something almost every day. So far I have yet to find a hack that was simple to learn and yet had the tools I needed to make my life better. What I needed was :

1) A dashboard that shows my activities for today and tomorrow as the weather. I  need to know how to dress as well as anticipate less than pleasant weather patterns.

2) I need a timer so that I can record start and stop times, so I can learn how long different task take me. For instance, I have zero idea have much time it takes me from wake up mode until it is time to leave the mothership and commence my day.

3) I also wanted to store and cross reference the data over time to find patterns of productivity.

4) Lastly, I wanted to make this extensible so that other's might benefit. Because of this, I will also maintain a repository of articles and endorsements of products, people and things that will help one have a brighter day.
