# Individual Project

### Overview

The Individual Enterprise Java Project is designed to facilitate a student’s transition from Madison College to an industry career though the development of a high-quality software product. The project will encourage students to think critically and solve challenging problems while developing skills critical to a successful career in Information Technology.  Upon completion, this project will be an important part of the student’s portfolio to be shared with potential employers.   

### Objectives

* Create an innovative, data-driven Java web site or application that solves a problem of interest to the student.
* Demonstrate effective use of the technologies and techniques learned in the program, with emphasis on Enterprise Java topics including 
	* Security. At minimum, register a new user and log into the application. 
	* Logging
	* Unit testing
	* Java frameworks/libraries (Hibernate)
	* Web service/s (at least one) consumed using Java
	* Database accessed using Java
* Incorporate a minimum of one technology/library/framework/tool that requires independent research (a topic not covered in class that is new to you).
* Demonstrate proper use of UI elements to create a visually pleasing, responsive application.
* Create a well-structured Java project.
* Use version control.
* Demonstrate the ability to effectively plan project work and execute that plan.
* Document the process and progress of the project.
* Articulate the application architecture and explain the technologies used.

### Deliverables

* Problem statement and project plan (detailed schedule for your project). Must be approved by instructor.
* Screen design and application flow.	
* Complete at least 3 design/code reviews with at least 2 peers and the instructor.
* Regular (minimum of weekly) time log or journal entries documenting progress and time spent on the project.
* Source code, HTML JavaDoc and all supporting materials, e.g., design documents, published on GitHub.
* Deploy the application to a publicly accessible location, i.e., host on AWS.
* Present completed project to the class. Demonstrate the application, explain the application architecture and discuss significant technical aspects of the project with emphasis on your independent research technology. 
* 
***** Video demonstration of the completed application published on GitHub.****

### Independent research topic ideas

Choose any java-related topic not covered in the curriculum that is **new** to you. Following are just a few ideas to get you thinking.

* One of the many [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=acquisition_US&sc_publisher=google&sc_medium=cloud_computing_b&sc_content=aws_url_e_control_q32016&sc_detail=amazon.%20web%20services&sc_category=cloud_computing&sc_segment=188908164670&sc_matchtype=e&sc_country=US&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!188908164670!e!!g!!amazon.%20web%20services&ef_id=WO1DJgAAL5bBGC8N:20170819192255:s) not covered in class (we will all be using EC2)
* Alternative build/dependency management tools such as Gradle
* Application performance monitoring tools
* Other languages that run on the JVM, e.g., Groovy, Clojure, Scala, JRuby etc. Consider writing some of your unit tests, or a small part of your project in a new language.
* One of the many JavaScript libraries/frameworks
* Continuous Integration: Jenkins/Hudson
* Contribute to an open source project
* Write a plugin for IntelliJ 
* Code quality tools
* Mocking libraries for unit testing
* Spring, Struts or JavaServer Faces (JSF) (these are large, advanced topics recommended for students really looking to challenge themselves).

### Checkpoints 
(10 pts each)

* **Checkpoint 1:** Problem statement, project plan, screen design and time log pushed to GitHub. Link to your repository [here](https://github.com/MadJavaEntFall2017/Student/blob/master/IndividualProjects.md). *Due before Week 3 class.*
* **Checkpoint 2:** Database designed and created, at least one DAO implemented with Hibernate, DAO is unit tested, Log4J is implemented (no System.out.printlns), class design and any other diagrams you plan to use have been created. *Due before Week 6 class.*
* **Checkpoint 3:** Deployed to AWS, at least one JSP that displays data from the database is implemented. *Due before Week 8 class.*


### Rubric

| Category  | Excellent |   Good    |   Fair    |   Poor    |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Project effectively utilizes the technologies and techniques specified in the project objectives (35%)|  Logging framework used, i.e., no System.out.println() or printStacktrace() statements.  Hibernate used for all data access. Authentication/Authorization implemeted. Consumes at least one web service or public api using Java. Application is database-driven using full CRUD.  Independent research topic effectively implemented. Deployed to AWS for public access. (31-35) | Fulfilled most of the scope. (28-31) | Fulfilled some significant portions of the project scope. (21-28) | Barely fulfilled the scope: significant portions are missing. (0-21) |
| Synthesis of multiple concepts in unfamiliar situations requiring research beyond the scope of the class. (10%) | Experiments individually, exhibits independence and drive, shows originality in the solution. (9-10) | Experiments on own with reliance on instructor or others for guidance. (8-9) | Attempted with heavy reliance on instructor for recommendations and help. (6-8) | No observable interest or effort shown. (0-6) |
| Code is readable, documented, efficient and well-tested. (15%) | Code is exceptionally well organized and easy to follow. Documentation is well written and clearly explains what the code is accomplishing and how. Code is extremely efficient without sacrificing readability/maintainability. Code has significant test coverage. (14-15) |  Code is fairly easy to follow. Documentation is somewhat useful in understanding the code. Code is efficient. Moderate test coverage. (12-14) | Code is fairly easy to follow with some exceptions. Documentation is incomplete. Code inefficiencies exist. Some test coverage. (9-12) | Code is poorly organized; documentation is simply embedded comments and does not help the reader understand the code; code is unnecessarily long and complex. Little to no test coverage.
